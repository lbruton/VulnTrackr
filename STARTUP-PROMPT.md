Hi! I just cloned the rEngine repository and opened it in VS Code. Please help me set up a new AI-powered project using the rEngine framework. 

Walk me through the setup by asking me for the following information, then automatically configure everything:

## Required Information:
1. **Project Name** (e.g., "MyAIApp")
2. **Project Description** (brief description)
3. **Primary Use Case** (web app, API, automation, etc.)
4. **AI Models** (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, local, etc.)

## What you should do automatically:
1. **Initialize MCP Memory** with project entities
2. **Update all template files** with my project details
3. **Configure agent protocols** for my use case
4. **Create project roadmap** in memory
5. **Setup backup systems**
6. **Generate customized documentation**
7. **Initialize git repository**
8. **Create initial project structure**

## Success criteria:
- MCP memory initialized with my project
- All files customized with my project name/details
- Agent coordination working
- Ready for development

Please start by asking me for the project details above, then proceed through the complete setup automatically. I want to end up with a fully configured, ready-to-use AI development environment.

**After this setup, I should be able to immediately start developing with full agent coordination and memory persistence.**
