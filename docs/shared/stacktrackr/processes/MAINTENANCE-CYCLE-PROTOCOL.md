# StackTrackr Maintenance Cycle Protocol

**Created**: 2025-08-15  
**Purpose**: Systematic maintenance routines for project health and memory continuity  
**Status**: Active Protocol

---

## üîÑ **Routine Maintenance Schedule**

### **üìÖ Weekly Maintenance (Every 7 Days)**

#### **1. Memory Gap Analysis (MGMT-002)**
**Frequency**: Weekly  
**Duration**: 1 hour  
**Responsibility**: Lead Agent / Project Manager

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Read complete memory graph using `mcp_memory_read_graph`
- [ ] Analyze current session context for missing information
- [ ] Identify weak points in memory coverage
- [ ] Review recent development activities not captured in memory
- [ ] Add missing entities for: active sessions, codebase state, user patterns, file architecture, technical debt
- [ ] Create relationships between new and existing entities
- [ ] Document memory gaps found and filled

**Critical Areas to Check**:
- ‚úÖ **Active Development Sessions** - Current work, git checkpoints, implementation status
- ‚úÖ **Current Codebase State** - Partial implementations, ongoing changes, file modifications
- ‚úÖ **User Workflow Patterns** - Communication style, preferences, delegation patterns
- ‚úÖ **File Architecture** - Critical paths, dependencies, key file roles
- ‚úÖ **Technical Debt** - Outstanding issues, unresolved bugs, incomplete features
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Project Context** - Multi-tool initiatives, design language efforts

#### **2. Roadmap Synchronization**
**Frequency**: Weekly  
**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Actions**:
- [ ] Review `docs/roadmap.md` for new items
- [ ] Update memory with any new bugs (BUG-###) or features (FEAT-###)
- [ ] Cross-reference roadmap items with memory entities
- [ ] Ensure all active issues are properly tracked in memory

#### **3. Agent Protocol Validation**
**Frequency**: Weekly  
**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Actions**:
- [ ] Verify `agents/agents.ai` initialization protocol compliance
- [ ] Check that roadmap checking is happening consistently
- [ ] Update agent protocols with any new maintenance requirements
- [ ] Validate memory queries are being used effectively

---

### **üìÖ Monthly Maintenance (Every 30 Days)**

#### **1. Comprehensive Roadmap Review (MGMT-005)**
**Frequency**: Monthly  
**Duration**: 2 hours

**Actions**:
- [ ] Full review of `docs/roadmap.md` for completed items
- [ ] Archive completed tasks and update status
- [ ] Reassess priorities based on project evolution
- [ ] Update effort estimates based on actual completion times
- [ ] Add new discovered requirements and enhancements

#### **2. Memory Graph Cleanup**
**Frequency**: Monthly  
**Duration**: 1 hour

**Actions**:
- [ ] Review memory entities for outdated information
- [ ] Clean up completed tasks and resolved issues
- [ ] Consolidate related entities where appropriate
- [ ] Update entity observations with current status
- [ ] Optimize memory relationships for better retrieval

#### **3. Cross-Project Coordination**
**Frequency**: Monthly  
**Duration**: 1 hour

**Actions**:
- [ ] Review StackTrackr, VulnTrackr, and Network Inventory Tool alignment
- [ ] Update design language implementation progress
- [ ] Synchronize shared components and patterns
- [ ] Update cross-project memory relationships

---

### **üö® Event-Driven Maintenance**

#### **After Major Changes**
**Trigger**: Git checkpoints, significant feature completions, bug fixes
**Duration**: 15-30 minutes

**Actions**:
- [ ] Update memory with implementation details
- [ ] Document lessons learned and patterns discovered
- [ ] Update roadmap with any scope changes
- [ ] Create entities for new bugs or issues discovered

#### **Before Agent Handoffs**
**Trigger**: Session ending, model switching, task delegation
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

**Actions**:
- [ ] Perform quick memory gap analysis
- [ ] Document current session state and progress
- [ ] Update task assignments and priorities
- [ ] Ensure next agent has complete context

## üõ†Ô∏è **Maintenance Tools and Commands**

### **Memory Analysis Commands**
```bash
# Read complete memory graph
mcp_memory_read_graph

# Search for specific memory gaps
mcp_memory_search_nodes "session OR implementation OR codebase"

# Add missing context
mcp_memory_create_entities [entities_array]
mcp_memory_create_relations [relations_array]
```

### **File System Health Checks**
```bash
# Check critical documentation files
ls -la docs/roadmap.md docs/TASK-ORGANIZATION-PLAN.md TODO-NEXT-SESSION.md

# Verify agent protocols
head -50 agents/agents.ai

# Check git status for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain
```

## üìä **Maintenance Success Metrics**

### **Memory Health Indicators**
- **Coverage Score**: % of active development captured in memory
- **Retrieval Accuracy**: Agent ability to find relevant context
- **Handoff Success**: Seamless transitions between agents
- **Context Preservation**: Zero context loss across sessions

### **Project Health Indicators**
- **Bug Resolution Time**: <24h for critical bugs
- **Task Completion Rate**: % of planned tasks completed on schedule
- **Design Consistency**: Cross-project design language adoption
- **Technical Debt Trend**: Decreasing over time

---

## üîß **Implementation Notes**

This maintenance cycle should be:
- **Integrated into agent initialization protocols**
- **Tracked in project management tools**
- **Documented in session logs**
- **Used as a quality gate for releases**

The protocol ensures that memory remains comprehensive, current, and useful for maintaining project continuity across all agent interactions.
