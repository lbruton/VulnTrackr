# Universal Agent Onboarding

## Quick Start
1. Read `.ragents` file in project root
2. Access project-specific protocols in rAgents repository
3. Sync with MCP memory system
4. Begin development with full context

## Zero Context Loss Protocol
- All agent instructions centralized in rAgents repo
- Project-specific protocols maintained separately
- Cross-project memory sharing enabled
- Instant productivity across all projects

## Repository Structure
Agent protocols are organized by project in the rAgents repository for centralized management and consistent updates.
